# Magit 2.11 released

I am excited to announce the release of Magit version 2.11, consisting
of 303 commits since the last feature release six month ago.  The
release notes can be found [here][relnotes].

# It's Magit!  A Git interface inside Emacs

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

For more information about Magit, see [https://magit.vc][home].

# Magit needs your help

I am currently running a [fundraising campaign][campaign] on
Kickstarter.  If it succeeds, then I can work on Magit full-time for
a whole year.  I am still overflowing with ideas, and depend on your
support to realize them.

I would love to work on Magit for at least another year and think that
its users would miss out on a lot of significant improvements if I
were unable to do so.  Magit and I are at a crossroad — either I can
intensive my efforts or I have to give up bringing the long time goals
to completion that I have been working toward for the past few years.

Magit is still far from fulfilling its potential and now I need your
help to get it there.  Visit the [campaign] to learn more about the
planned improvements and please consider to make a contribution.

Thanks for your support!<br>

# New in 2.11

Even just maintaining Magit, without moving in any new directions, is
a lot of work.  For the last six months I did not have much time to go
beyond that, so most of the changes in this release are bug fixes and
small incremental changes.  Most of that is too boring to be listed
here.  See the full [release notes][relnotes] for details.  (That
doesn't mean that I am running out of ideas — [far from it][roadmap].)

Fortunately a few users have stepped up and contributed some new
features, including but not limited to the following.

* [Damien Cassou] added support for [Imenu] in Magit log, revision,
  and status buffers.  Like in other buffers that support Imenu you
  can use `M-x imenu` to quickly jump somewhere in the buffer.  You
  probably want to bind that command to some key.

* [Yuri Khan] added [Bookmarks] support for Magit status, refs, log,
  reflog, stashes, cherry, diff, revision, stash, and submodule-list
  buffers.
  
They have both done an excellent job implementing a feature that has
been requested before but that I would probably not have found the
time to implement myself any time soon.  I would also like to thank
[Kyle Meyer] who not only reviewed these changes but also implemented
many changes and fixes himself, and generally helps a lot of with the
day to day work such as dealing with bug reports and reviewing pull
requests.

* The most significant of his changes in this release probably is the
  new option `magit-use-sticky-arguments`, which he actually proposed
  quite some time ago but which I rejected initially.  Sometimes it
  helps to show some patience when dealing with a stubborn
  maintainer. ;-)
  
  If you often find that diff and log buffers use arguments that you
  set earlier but that you did not expect to be reused again, then
  customize this option to make arguments less "sticky".
  
* When a revision is shown from a log buffer, then the revision buffer
  now inherits the file restriction of the log buffer, if any.

* Magit's commands for running arbitrary `git` commands (available in
  the popup bound to `!`) used to be much less pleasant to use than
  the generic `async-shell-command` but some users still preferred
  them because of some of the specialization.  Now they are just as
  capable as `async-shell-command` but also preserve the
  specialization.
  
  To make full use of that you should use a package like `pcmpl-git`
  or `bash-completion`, which add command-line completion to these
  commands.
  
* Inserting information about submodules into status buffers is much
  faster now.  Some other performance improvements were also made.
