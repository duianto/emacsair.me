# Magit 2.9 released

I am excited to announce the release of Magit version 2.9, consisting
of 250 commits since the last feature release 15 weeks ago.  The
release notes can be found [here][relnotes].

# It's Magit!  A Git interface inside Emacs

Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented
as an Emacs package.  Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain.
While we cannot (yet) claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each
and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced
Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks
directly from within Emacs.  While many fine Git clients exist, only
Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

For more information about Magit, see [https://magit.vc][home].

# A new magical logo

Dmitriy from [Prospect One][pro1] created a [new][mlogo] magical logo
for Magit, inspired by [Git's logo][glogo].  Thanks a lot!

# A big and slightly boring release

With its 250 commits, this release is larger than the other feature
releases this year.  Like mentioned in the announcement of the
previous release, we did concentrate on bug fixes and cleaning things
up.  Additionally many features saw minor improvements that aren't bug
fixes but still aren't all that noteworthy when looked at in
isolation.

This release also contains a number of breaking changes, most of which
can be easily reverted.

Please refer to the [release notes][relnotes] for the full list of
changes, including instructions on how to revert the breaking changes,
near the beginning of the file.

# Improved and consistent behavior of RET

Two of the more noticeable changes involve the bindings of the `RET`
(`return`) key in various places.  These are both breaking changes.

`RET` is supposed to do the same thing everywhere: it should visit the
thing at point by showing extended information about it in another,
dedicated buffer.  `RET` is Magit's primary dwim key binding.  While
it always "visits something", what exactly it visits is highly context
sensitive.

* Users quickly learn that it is safe to just press `RET` in some
  unfamiliar context because doing so never has any side-effects.
  (At least when `RET` isn't part of a key *sequence*.  Of course
  something like `M-x magit-branch-delete RET master RET` is a
  destructive action.  But the difference is obvious.)
  
  Unfortunately, for historic reasons, there was one exception to that
  rule.  In a references buffer `RET` used to check out the reference
  at point, potentially even resulting in a detached HEAD.  That is
  certainly very surprising, very much a side-effect, and due to the
  caused confusion possibly dangerous.
  
  This inconsistent behavior has existed until now because the last
  time I tried to fix it, that change was met with protests by users
  who often use that buffer to check out another branch.  And indeed
  for that use-case `RET` is much more convenient than `b b RET` (the
  key binding one would have to use in other buffers, and now also in
  the references buffer).
  
  Back then I reverted the change but added an option to allow users
  to optionally make the behavior consistent.  Now, after having
  abstained from changing any key bindings for quite some time, I have
  decided that it is much more important that `RET` is consistent and
  absolutely never has any side-effect, than to avoid upsetting any
  muscle-memory.  Please note that you can trivially revert this
  change locally, by adding `(setq magit-visit-ref-behavior
  '(checkout-any focus-on-ref))` to your init file.
  
* While `RET` now behaves consistently across all of Magit, that does
  not mean that its behavior cannot be further improved.  This release
  also comes with a few such changes involving diffs.
  
  When point is on a removed line inside a diff, then `RET` now visits
  the commit that still had that line, not the commit which removed
  it.  Considering that point is on a removed line, `RET` is supposed
  to visit the thing at point, and that it is not possible to visit
  something in a place where it no longer exists, I think this makes
  a lot of sense.  But since Magit did not use to behave that way it
  might be surprising at first.  You can easily revert this change by
  adding `(setq magit-diff-visit-previous-blob nil)` to your init
  file.
  
  Also note that at least for the time being staged changes are
  excluded from this new behavior.  When showing a diff with staged
  changes, then `RET` still always visits the file in the working
  tree, not some blob.
  
  By the way, you can always visit the file in the working tree, even
  when Magit would normally visit some blob.  Just use `M-RET` instead
  of `RET`.  In that case Magit may or may not succeed putting point
  on exactly the correct line, but its much more likely now that it
  does.
  
There are two more changes involving `RET` inside diffs, which are not
breaking changes:

* When visiting a file or blob buffer by pressing `RET` while point is
  inside a diff, then the position this jumps to is now accurate (even
  when jumping to the file in the working tree from a diff that wasn't
  about changes in the working tree).

* When visiting a file or blob buffer by pressing `RET` while point is
  inside a diff, then the buffer may be widened but only if necessary.
  If it isn't necessary to widen the buffer to jump to the appropriate
  location, because that position falls into the narrowed region, then
  the buffer isn't widened.

# Some other changes

* If you have embraced the push-remote, then it probably bothers you
  that creating a new local branch from a remote feature branch always
  sets that remote branch as the upstream, because in a triangular
  work-flow that branch is already the push-branch and the upstream
  should be something like `master` or `origin/master`.  Using the new
  option `magit-branch-adjust-remote-upstream-alist`, you can now tell
  Magit's branching commands to automatically set the upstream to what
  you would otherwise configure manually.
  
* Hunk refinement is faster now.  Possibly even fast enough for you to
  `(setq magit-diff-refine-hunk 'all)` to refine all hunks instead of
  just the selected one.

* The cache that is used to limit the number of calls to `git` during
  a refresh was improved, so that `git config` only has to be called
  once (with the `--list` argument).  That should improve performance
  significantly on Windows.
