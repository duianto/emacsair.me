# Ghub 2.0 and Glab 2.0 released

I am excited to announce the release of Ghub version 2.0 and Glab 2.0,
consisting of 115 commits since the last Ghub feature release four
months ago.

# Minuscule client library for the Github API

Ghub is a library that provides basic support for using the Github
REST (v3) and GraphQL (v4) APIs from Emacs packages.  It abstracts
access to API resources using only a handful of functions that are
not resource-specific.

Ghub handles the creation, storage and use of access tokens using a
setup wizard to make it easier for users to get started and to reduce
the support burden imposed on package maintainers.  It also comes with
a comprehensive manual to address the cases when things don't just
work as expected or in case you don't want to use the wizard.

Ghub is intentionally limited to only provide these two essential
features—basic request functions and guided setup—to avoid being
too opinionated, which would hinder wide adoption.  It is assumed that
wide adoption would make life easier for users and maintainers alike,
because then all packages that talk to the Github API could be
configured the same way.

Likewise Glab does the same for Gitlab, except without support for
GraphQL and automatic token creation, because Gitlab itself does not
support these features.

# Why another client library?

#### Ghub is less opinionated

I originally wrote Ghub two years ago for use by [Emir], the primary
tool I use to maintain the [Emacsmirror].

Previously I had been using and contributing to [Gh], but was having
issues with it that made it desirable to start from scratch.  In my
opinion Gh is too—ahem—opinionated.  It doesn't return raw results but
instead wraps them in Eieio objects and more awkwardly it also expects
objects as input in some cases.  But if that were the only issue I
would probably have stuck to it.  (Actually Gh was my first exposure
to Eieio, which I really like by now and use in other packages.  So
thanks for that!  I just don't think it should have been used here.)

Additionally I got a lot of random errors when using Gh and never
quite figured out who was to blame—might have been my own code, Gh,
`url.el` or Github.com.  At the time I though `url.el` was to be
blamed and that Gh in turn was making it hard to figure out what was
going on, though I might have been completely wrong.  (Maybe now that
I am more familiar with Eieio, its use would no longer make it hard
for me to debug these issues.)

Since then I have been using Ghub to maintain the Emacsmirror and made
small improvements over time.  And then I decided that a lot of Github
functionality should be available directly from within [Magit].  Which
not only meant that I finally had to address all the minor issues I
was having with Ghub but also that I had to improve the initial
configuration.

#### Alternative interfaces can be layered on top of Ghub

One major issue that users of the various packages that accessed the
Github API have, is that these packages all have different
expectations on how the necessary tokens should be made available to
them.  Well not all—some use Gh—but many package authors decided to
role their own, much like I had done too and I suspect they did so for
similar reasons.

What better way to fix that situation than to implement yet another
configuration mechanism?

I hope that's not how this plays out.  Keeping Ghub rather flexible
and easy to build on was a major goal and I am hoping that other, more
opinionated interfaces will be built on top.  I am happy that one such
interface, named simply [Ghub+], already exist and it should be fairly
simple to port Gh to use it too.  (Could Someone™ please do that?)

Ghub comes with many features that should make it appealing to use it
instead of the existing libraries.  Or to use a library that is built
on top of it.

Ghub comes with a setup wizard that automatically pops up when the
required token is not available.  This wizard works even if two-factor
authentication is enabled.  Of course users can also create and store
the token manually if they prefer.  But its existence should lessen
the support burden imposed on maintainers *and* make it easier for
users.

Tokens are stored using `auth-source`, which is the package that Emacs
provides for that sort of thing, so using it seems like a good idea.
That package is rather flexible and allows storing packages
unencrypted for ease of use or encrypted if you would like to protect
your secrets.  It supports multiple backends including some popular
keychains and can be extended to support even more.

And finally, Ghub comes with a [manual].  When using the wizard, then
things should just work, but if it doesn't, then the documentation
comes in handy.  Please do consult it.

### Github support in Magit and Magithub

As mentioned before Magit is going to gain a lot of Github related
functionality.  I haven't progresses very far with that yet, mostly
because getting Ghub ready took longer than expected.

But at least Magit's upcoming 2.12 release will contain some seemingly
small features that make a huge difference at least in my own daily
work.

The new `magit-checkout-pull-request` and `magit-branch-pull-request`
commands (on <i>b y</i> and <i>b Y</i>) read a pull request in the
minibuffer and then create a local branch for that.  That branch is
properly configured, including the upstream and push-remote.  This
makes it a breeze to review pull requests directly in Magit.  (Though
for the time being you will still have to provide feedback using the
web interface, but see below.)  You should also checkout the new
`magit-merge-into` and `magit-merge-absorb` commands (on <i>m i</i>
and <i>m a</i>).  After merging a branch they also delete it and if
the branch was created using one of the pull-request commands
mentioned above (and some other conditions are met), then they also
delete the respective remote.

Meanwhile the [Magithub] package provides a lot of the functionality
that I want to add to Magit itself (and then some).  It was written
and is actively maintained by Sean Allred who is also the author of
Ghub+.  We have been collaborating for a while now.  His feedback
about Ghub was very useful and I think he feels the same about my
feedback about Ghub+ and Magithub.

I like Magithub's interface and it provides a lot of useful
functionality but think it has some sharp edges concerning how Github
data is fetched.  Because of that I haven't integrated it into my own
workflow until very recently, but many users already have and the
feedback seems to be very positive.  Aside from some "offline mode"
and performance issues I already like it a lot too.

Going forward I intend to keep collaborating with Sean to avoid
duplicating efforts.  Meanwhile I recommend that you give Magithub a
try too.  I will probably concentrate on data fetching and caching for
a while before I turn my focus to user-visible features.  This work
will hopefully benefit Magithub and that in turn should benefit Magit.
Maybe Magithub could even be merged into Magit one day, but it is to
early to tell whether that will become feasible and be desirable.
