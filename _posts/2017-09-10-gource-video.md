# Halftime!
## Another year of Magit development 50% funded

The last then days have been very exciting and it is time to have a
little celebration.  Today the [Magit campaign][campaign] reached half
of the funding goal.  Thanks so much to all of you who have already
backed the campaign!  You are amazing.

(A similar video can be found at the bottom of [magit.vc][homepage],
which is crisper and more fast paced but lacks the glow.)

Of course there are still 50% to go and those are the harder 50%, so
please keep telling friends and followers about the campaign.  I need
all the support I can get.  Thanks again!
